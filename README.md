# Accelerating Decision-Making for Smart Stormwater Management Through SWMM Surrogate Modeling for Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the official code and resources for the current preprint: "Accelerating Decision-Making for Smart Stormwater Management Through SWMM Surrogate Modeling for Reinforcement Learning".

## Overview

This research addresses the computational bottleneck in applying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to the Real-Time Control (RTC) of urban stormwater systems. We develop and validate a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) surrogate model to emulate a high-fidelity, multi-pond SWMM model of the Conner Creek watershed in Knoxville, TN.

The surrogate model enables a 33-fold acceleration in the training of an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent, allowing it to converge to a competent multi-objective control policy for flood and erosion mitigation within a practical time budget.
